# MongoPlay

Just for simple Mongo and Mongoose examples in Node.js.
The examples have names like `*.example.js` and you can
run them in a shell by name e.g. `./user.example.js`.

Most of the configurable options are hardcoded,
so there is no input, and the output is simply
 `console.log` or `console.error`.
